TwitterNow
Released March 31, 2011

Description:
TwitterNow allows you to search the Twitter search stream for keywords and limit the results by geography. The results are populated into a database. It also attempts to do some rudimentary geocoding once the data is retrieved from the stream, by using TinyGeocoder API to match the user-defined location on the biography page to a physical latitude and longitude. A MySQL database is required. The schema is also included.

It uses jQuery, jQuery UI.

Usage:
* Rename config_sample.php to config and add database info.
* Be sure to run the MySQL schema file.

Please contact rio@cs.stanford.edu for questions or concerns. I would also be interested in its future applications and utility!
